# title: ConPR Ongoing Construction Site Dataset for Place Recognition 
## publish date: 
**2024-07-04** 
## authors: 
  Dongjae Lee et.al. 
## abstract: 
  Place recognition, an essential challenge in computer vision and robotics, involves identifying previously visited locations. Despite algorithmic progress, challenges related to appearance change persist, with existing datasets often focusing on seasonal and weather variations but overlooking terrain changes. Understanding terrain alterations becomes critical for effective place recognition, given the aging infrastructure and ongoing city repairs. For real-world applicability, the comprehensive evaluation of algorithms must consider spatial dynamics. To address existing limitations, we present a novel multi-session place recognition dataset acquired from an active construction site. Our dataset captures ongoing construction progress through multiple data collections, facilitating evaluation in dynamic environments. It includes camera images, LiDAR point cloud data, and IMU data, enabling visual and LiDAR-based place recognition techniques, and supporting sensor fusion. Additionally, we provide ground truth information for range-based place recognition evaluation. Our dataset aims to advance place recognition algorithms in challenging and dynamic settings. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/dongjae0107/ConPR.
