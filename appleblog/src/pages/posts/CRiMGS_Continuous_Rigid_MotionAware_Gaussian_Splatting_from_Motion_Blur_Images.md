# title: CRiMGS Continuous Rigid MotionAware Gaussian Splatting from Motion Blur Images 
## publish date: 
**2024-07-04** 
## authors: 
  Junghe Lee et.al. 
## abstract: 
  Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have received significant attention due to their high-quality novel view rendering ability, prompting research to address various real-world cases. One critical challenge is the camera motion blur caused by camera movement during exposure time, which prevents accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose continuous rigid motion-aware gaussian splatting (CRiM-GS) to reconstruct accurate 3D scene from blurry images with real-time rendering speed. Considering the actual camera motion blurring process, which consists of complex motion patterns, we predict the continuous movement of the camera based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we leverage rigid body transformations to model the camera motion with proper regularization, preserving the shape and size of the object. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous deformable 3D transformation in the \textit{SE(3)} field to adapt the rigid body transformation to real-world problems by ensuring a higher degree of freedom. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and employing advanced neural network training techniques, we achieve accurate modeling of continuous camera trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets.
