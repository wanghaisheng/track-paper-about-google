# title: Sensitivity and Performance of LBTINOMIC Spectroscopy Prospects for 10 and 30meter class MidIR Exoplanet Science 
## publish date:

## abstract: 
  Long wavelength infrared (8-13 $\mu$m) spectroscopy is invaluable for detecting molecular features in the atmospheres of gas giant and terrestrial exoplanets. The nulling-optimized mid-infrared camera (NOMIC) on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) has a low resolution (R$\sim$200) germanium grism that was previously installed but has not been characterized and commissioned for scientific observations. Using a 1.27 mm slit and broadband filter in combination with the grism, the infrared window between 8-13 $\mu$m can be captured. We describe initial on sky testing of the LBTI/NOMIC grism mode with adaptive optics to study standard stars and binaries. We discuss the impact of observational strategy and telluric calibration on the spectral reduction process. We infer the impact of existing mid-infrared detectors on NOMIC's spectroscopic mode and discuss requirements to enable higher resolution 8-13 $\mu$m spectroscopy on current and future facilities.
